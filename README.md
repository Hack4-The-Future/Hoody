# Description:

In our application everyone will be able to sell and donation, and in the feature will get the best price of items in local area. 
Every user will have a dashboard that can find each other with map, and chat with each other in order to take and give their items. And will be have a explore page to find second-hand items, and also they can post own second-hand items to sell with a price or free donate to NGO. 
By these actions we expected to reduce consumptions, pollutions make culture in society to use Second-hand items. With this solution everyone every time will sell or donate their second-hand at proper time that is still reusable. 
E.g. when children have toys that do not use anymore will donate to others children at proper time, the means of proper time: some time we have something that we do not use it but due to non-existence solution to sell it or donate, we postpone it to other time to find someone, and eventually maybe we should throw away without using.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
